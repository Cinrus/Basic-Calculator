# Basic-Calculator
This is a basic calculator project with the goal of getting me some experience in creating a GUI.

The goal of this project was to get experience in creating a GUI. There are some basic functions of other calculators that are missing in this one because they were considered outside the original scope. This cannot chain opperations together. It also doesn't use scientific notation, and numbers that don't fit on the display just return "Error".
